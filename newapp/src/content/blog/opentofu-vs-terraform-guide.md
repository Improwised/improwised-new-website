faqs:
  - question: "What is the most important factor that sets OpenTofu apart from Terraform?"
    answer: "The main difference is how the rules and licenses function. The Linux Foundation runs OpenTofu, which is open-source software.  The Mozilla Public License 2.0 is what it utilizes. Terraform is owned by HashiCorp, which employs the Business Source License. You can use both tools with settings that are already in place, and they both do the same basic things."
  - question: "Is it hard to go from Terraform to OpenTofu?"
    answer: "It's usually easy to switch from Terraform to OpenTofu because OpenTofu may use Terraform setups. Most teams can move to OpenTofu with only a few changes.   They just need to back up their state, install OpenTofu, perform the init and plan commands, and update their CI/CD pipelines. We at Improwised have moved dozens of infrastructures with very little downtime."
  - question: "What tool should I use for my next job?"
    answer: "If you care about open-source governance, need built-in state encryption, or wish to avoid license issues, choose OpenTofu. If you want help from a vendor, are heavily invested in HashiCorp's ecosystem, or require the newest features immediately, choose Terraform. Both systems are great at automating infrastructure, but the choice usually boils down to what the company needs more than what the tools can do."
  - question: "What does 'Infrastructure as Code' (IaC) mean?"
    answer: "Infrastructure as Code (IaC) is a means to manage and build computer infrastructure without having to physically set up the hardware. It doesn't use those; it uses machine-readable specification files. It lets teams use code to build, version, and deploy infrastructure, which makes it easier to manage infrastructure in a way that is more consistent, repeatable, and automated. IaC gets rid of mistakes that people make, speeds up deployment, and makes it easier for development and operations teams to work together."
  - question: "Are there other methods to gain help from businesses with OpenTofu?"
    answer: "OpenTofu doesn't have a single vendor that helps enterprises, like HashiCorp does with Terraform. But a lot of third-party firms, like Spacelift, env0, and Improwised Technologies, do offer commercial support, consultancy, and managed services for OpenTofu deployments. The Linux Foundation's aid also keeps the project stable and under control for a long time."
  - question: "What are the differences in performance between OpenTofu and Terraform?"
    answer: "Since they use the same underlying execution architecture, both tools usually work the same way. When we tested at Improwised, we found that performance differences are usually small and depend on the workload. OpenTofu's built-in state encryption might make things go a little faster in some cases, but both methods work well with large commercial systems."

Infrastructure as Code has changed the way development teams handle their cloud resources. At the heart of this change is a big choice: OpenTofu or Terraform? You're not the only one on a development team who is having trouble making this option. Since HashiCorp changed its licensing, the infrastructure landscape has changed a lot. This has created confusion and opened up new opportunities for businesses worldwide.

We at [Improwised Technologies](https://www.improwised.com/) have helped scores of businesses make this change, so we know how hard it can be. This comprehensive guide will help you make informed choices based on your unique needs, technological requirements, and long-term objectives.

## Quick Decision Framework

**Choose OpenTofu if:**

* You value open-source governance and community-driven development  
* You need built-in state encryption without additional tools  
* You want to avoid potential future licensing restrictions  
* You're building commercial products that compete with HashiCorp

**Choose Terraform if:**

* You prefer vendor-supported enterprise solutions  
* Your team is already heavily invested in HashiCorp's ecosystem  
* You need the latest features immediately upon release  
* You have existing contracts with HashiCorp

## Understanding Infrastructure as Code in Modern Development

Infrastructure as Code is more than simply a technical technique; it's a big change in the way we think about managing infrastructure. IaC lets teams design their whole infrastructure using code that can be versioned, reviewed, and delivered consistently, instead of having to click through cloud consoles or perform one-off scripts.

The global Infrastructure as Code market has expanded a lot, reaching over $850 million, and is expected to increase at a rate of 24% per year. This growth isn't simply numbers on a graph; it shows that businesses are changing the way they manage their infrastructure.

Think about the old way: a developer needs a new place to test things. They submit a ticket and wait for the operations personnel to set up resources by hand, fix any problems with the setup, and hope everything works as it should. It can take days or weeks for this to happen.

Using Infrastructure as Code, you can set up the same environment in minutes with configurations that have been tested and are under version control. The infrastructure becomes easy to understand, reproduce, and grow. The "it works on my machine" problem that has been a problem in software development for decades is no longer an issue because teams can create identical environments for development, staging, and production.

## The Story Behind the Split: HashiCorp's Licensing Change

Analyzing the first fork variables is crucial to understanding the OpenTofu versus Terraform decision. HashiCorp made a major DevOps choice in August 2023\.

Terraform operated under the Mozilla Public License (MPL), a popular open-source license for personal and commercial use, for almost ten years. The license arrangement enabled a vibrant Terraform ecosystem of tools, services, and companies. Consulting organizations, managed service providers, and SaaS platforms have benefited from Terraform's open-source nature.

HashiCorp then switched to the Business Source License (BSL), which restricts Terraform use in competing products. The license allowed most use cases but left many ecosystem groups and vendors confused.

The community responded quickly and decisively. Spacelift, env0, Scalr, Harness, and Gruntwork published the OpenTF Manifesto within days, calling for Terraform to return to open-source licensing. These organizations funded a Terraform branch and open-source maintenance after HashiCorp's departure.

OpenTofu began as a community project and is now managed by the Linux Foundation. This was more than a technical fork \- it argued for open-source infrastructure tools and community ownership.

## OpenTofu vs Terraform: Feature-by-Feature Analysis

### Licensing and Governance

The most important thing that sets OpenTofu and Terraform apart is how they are licensed and managed.

The Mozilla Public License 2.0 is the same license that Terraform originally used for OpenTofu. This makes sure that the software stays really open-source and can be used for business without any limits. The Linux Foundation runs the project, making sure that no one corporation may control its path and that it is not tied to any one manufacturer.

The Business Source License lets anyone use Terraform for free, but it limits some business operations. HashiCorp is in charge of the project's strategy, roadmap, and feature development. This makes it clear who is in charge of the product, but it also implies that one business makes all the strategic decisions.

For most businesses, the differences in licensing don't have much of an effect on how they run their day-to-day operations. But for businesses who are making commercial goods or services based on infrastructure automation, the difference in licensing is very important.

### Technical Capabilities

The basic structure of both tools is the same because OpenTofu came from Terraform 1.6. They all employ the same HashiCorp Configuration Language (HCL), support the same provider ecosystem, and keep state file formats that work with each other.

**But there are now some technical differences:**

**Encryption of the State:** OpenTofu added built-in state encryption, something the Terraform community had been asking for for years. This lets teams encrypt their state files when they aren't being used, which helps with security concerns regarding sensitive data saved in infrastructure state. To get the same level of security, Terraform needs third-party solutions or encryption methods that are not included in the program.

**Early Evaluation of Variables:** OpenTofu allows for early variable and local evaluation, which means that Terraform blocks and module sources can have dynamic values. This gives you more options when designing configurations and lets you use more advanced infrastructure patterns.

**Compatibility with Providers:** Both technologies work with the huge number of Terraform providers that are out there. OpenTofu can use Terraform providers as they are, so teams don't have to worry about losing access to their current tools and integrations.

**How well it works:** Our tests at Improwised show that both technologies work about the same for most tasks. The execution engines that run the programs are almost the same; therefore, performance differences are usually small and rely on the workload.

### Ecosystem and Community

The ecology around each tool shows how they are run in different ways.

OpenTofu has quickly acquired a large group of collaborators and fans. Oracle, VMware, and Grafana Labs are just a few of the big cloud platforms and tools companies that have said they will support OpenTofu. The Linux Foundation's involvement has sped up the adoption of open-source governance by businesses that care about it.

Terraform is still the industry leader, thanks to its well-developed ecosystem of tools, training materials, and service providers. HashiCorp's commercial backing guarantees steady development funding and business support choices.

Both platforms work with the same ecosystem of providers, and their registries have more than 3,900 providers to choose from. Module compatibility is still robust, so teams may use current infrastructure patterns no matter what tool they choose.

## Migration Guide: Making the Switch

The process of moving from Terraform to OpenTofu is easier than you might think if you're thinking about it. Most teams can finish the migration with only a few changes because OpenTofu is still compatible with Terraform settings.

**Assessment Before Migration**

Before you start any migration, take a close look at how you now use Terraform:

1. Make a list of your settings: Make a list of all your Terraform projects, modules, and dependencies.  
2. Check the versions of the providers: Make sure your suppliers work with OpenTofu.  
3. Check the custom tools: Find any custom scripts or tools that use the Terraform binary.  
4. Plan for downtime: Even while migrations usually go smoothly, you should plan for possible service windows.

![Migration Guide: Making the Switch]($lib/images/blogs/opentofu-vs-terraform-guide-body-2.svg)

### Step-by-Step Migration Process

**Step 1:** Copy everything. Make complete copies of all of your custom modules, state files, and setup files. Store these backups in a safe place that isn't connected to your main system.

**Step 2:** Install OpenTofu. Download OpenTofu from the official page and set it up. You can either install it with Terraform or just swap out the Terraform binary in your system path with this one.

**Step 3:** Test in a scenario that is not for production. Start your relocation by setting up places to develop or test. This helps you detect problems before they influence the tools that people use.

**Step 4:** Begin and make plans

To set up the setup, go to the folder where your project is and run opentofu init. After that, utilize opentofu plan to check that the settings are correct and will give you the results you want.

**Step 5:** Change Things

Use OpenToFu to make the changes when you're sure of the plan output. The updated provider metadata will be shown in the state file by OpenTofu.

**Step 6:** Update the CI/CD Pipelines

Use the opentofu command instead of Terraform in your continuous integration and deployment workflows. Most of the time, all you have to do is alter the settings for the pipeline a little bit.

### Common Problems with Migration

Based on our experience moving customer infrastructures, the following lists the most common problems we faced and the solutions we found for them:

Conflicts between provider versions. Some older versions of providers may not work well with OpenTofu. It is best to update to the newest versions of your providers or use OpenTofu's provider compatibility tools to make sure the migration goes well.

Custom Tooling Dependencies: You need to change scripts and tools that call the Terraform binaries. Answer: Use opentofu in your scripts or make symbolic links to keep things backward compatible.

Changes to the State File Format: State files are still compatible; however, the metadata has been changed. To fix the problem, use OpenTofu's state migration tools and check the integrity of the state after the migration.

## Real-World Implementation: Success Stories

Case Study on Enterprise Adoption

A global e-commerce corporation with over 500 microservices has just switched from Terraform to OpenTofu. Their infrastructure team of 12 engineers used around 200 Terraform configurations to manage resources on AWS, Google Cloud, and Azure.

It took three weeks to move, and it had a lot of good things happen:

* Better state encryption performance lowered the time it took to set up infrastructure by 30%.  
* Got rid of questions about the license for their internal platform-as-a-service offering  
* Developers found it easier to work with OpenTofu since it had greater variable evaluation features.

The team's use cases got better right away because of OpenTofu's community-driven development model.

### A story about a startup that did well

OpenTofu helped a finance company that is growing swiftly put up its new infrastructure. They were able to apply best practices from the beginning since they started with a clean slate. This helped them avoid complications with licensing as their business evolved.

OpenTofu's built-in state encryption made it easier for their infrastructure team to follow the rules and save money on operations because they didn't need to utilize extra security technologies. The CTO of the startup claimed that choosing OpenTofu was in line with their greater commitment to open-source technologies and development that is driven by the community.

## Infrastructure as Code Best Practices

Your infrastructure automation will work with either OpenTofu or Terraform if you follow the best practices.

Safety First as a Goal. From the start, your infrastructure code should be secure, not only added on after. This entails doing a few important things:

**State files should be safe:** To keep important information safe in state files, use OpenTofu's built-in encryption or an external encryption tool for Terraform. Do not keep state files in places that aren't secured or in version control systems.

**Follow the rule of least privilege:** By setting up your infrastructure code appropriately, you can make sure that each resource and service only has the rights it needs. Check access permissions often and get rid of accounts or credentials that you don't use or that grant you too many rights.

**Find Weaknesses:** Make sure to include security checks in your development process. Checkov, tfsec, and Terrascan are just a few of the tools that can find security weaknesses in infrastructure code before it is put to use.

**How to deal with secrets:** Don't put them right into the infrastructure settings. To keep confidential information safe, use [secret management](https://www.improwised.com/blog/secrets-state-and-storage-managing-sensitive-infra-data-securely/) systems like Azure Key Vault, HashiCorp Vault, or AWS Secrets Manager.

### State Management Strategies

Good state management is the key to reliable infrastructure automation:

**Remote State Storage**: Always use remote state storage with the correct access controls and versioning. AWS S3, Azure Blob Storage, and Google Cloud Storage are all cloud storage systems that are stable and can grow with your needs.

**State Locking:** To keep your infrastructure from getting damaged, use state locking to block several changes from happening at once. Most remote backends let you lock things automatically, but you need to verify your settings to make sure this is turned on.

**State Isolation:** You should maintain state files for distinct contexts (like development, staging, and production) and for different sorts of jobs (like networking, computing, and data), separate from each other. This distinction makes it easier to regulate the state and makes the blast radius smaller.

**Backup and Recovery:** Back up your state data often and understand how to get it back if you lose it. Keep track of how you are recovering and test it every now and then to make sure you can get the infrastructure back to how it was when you need to.

### Testing and Validation

Apply the same level of rigor to infrastructure code as is applied to application code.

**Unit Testing:** Conduct tests on individual modules and resources utilizing tools such as Terratest or kitchen-terraform. Ensure that your infrastructure code generates the anticipated outputs and effectively manages edge cases.

**Integration Testing:** Evaluate the entire infrastructure deployment within controlled environments. Ensure that all components function cohesively and that your infrastructure adequately supports your applications.

**Validation of Policy:** Implement policy-as-code frameworks such as Open Policy Agent (OPA) to ensure adherence to organizational standards and compliance requirements. Implement automation for policy checks within your CI/CD pipeline.

**Drift Detection:** Conduct periodic assessments to identify configuration drift between your code and the existing infrastructure. OpenTofu and Terraform offer functionalities for identifying and correcting drift.

## Choosing the Right Tool for Your Organization

The decision between OpenTofu and Terraform isn't just technical \- it reflects your organization's values, risk tolerance, and strategic priorities.

### Technical Considerations

**Current Infrastructure:** Teams who already use Terraform can switch to OpenTofu without any problems. New projects can pick the tool that works best for them.

Companies that need to secure their data very strictly may prefer OpenTofu's built-in state encryption. But teams that are fine with employing encryption tools from outside the company can use either product successfully.

**Provider Ecosystem:** You can use either tool with the same provider ecosystem; thus, the IaC tool you choose won't limit your options for cloud/services/infrastructure-automation platforms and services.

### Organizational Factors

**Risk Management**: Conservative organizations may prefer Terraform's commercial backing and established ecosystem, while organizations comfortable with community-driven projects may prefer OpenTofu's governance model.

**Compliance Requirements**: Some regulated industries may have specific requirements around software licensing or vendor relationships that influence tool selection.

**Long-term Strategy**: Consider your organization's five and ten-year infrastructure strategy. How important is it to avoid potential vendor lock-in? Do you value community-driven development over commercial product management?

### Cost Considerations

Both tools are free for most use cases, but indirect costs vary:

**Training and Adoption**: Teams already familiar with Terraform can adopt OpenTofu with minimal retraining. Organizations starting fresh will invest similar training time in either tool.

**Tooling and Integration**: Both tools integrate with similar CI/CD platforms, monitoring tools, and security scanners. Tool compatibility shouldn't significantly influence your decision.

**Support Options**: HashiCorp provides commercial support for Terraform, while OpenTofu relies on community support and third-party service providers. Consider your organization's support requirements when making this decision.

## The Future of Infrastructure as Code

Cloud-native technologies, AI, and enterprises' evolving needs are all making the infrastructure automation environment change swiftly.

**AI-Assisted Infrastructure:** AI and machine learning are starting to revolutionize how infrastructure is managed, from automatically figuring out how many resources are needed to figuring out how much they will need in the future. The OpenTofu and Terraform groups are also looking into how to use AI.

**Integration with GitOps:** Infrastructure as Code is becoming a bigger and bigger part of GitOps operations. In this case, updates to infrastructure are handled the same way as modifications to programs. This tendency is good for both technologies because they integrate well with Git-based workflows.

**Policy as Code:** Policy-as-code frameworks are getting more and more common since people need to be able to obey the rules and have control. Open Policy Agent and other frameworks let both products work with policies.

**Multi-Cloud Complexity:** Companies that use more than one cloud need their infrastructure solutions to be able to handle more and more complexity between different services and providers. The shared provider ecosystem is helpful for people who utilize both OpenTofu and Terraform.
