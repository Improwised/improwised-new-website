## Top 10 Companies Excelling in Infrastructure as Code & Platform Automation

Infrastructure as Code (IaC) is an evolution of prior approaches, in which IT infrastructure is managed and deployed using machine-readable definition files or code. These files allow automation, standardisation, and machine management of infrastructure configuration, making repeatable, consistent, and scalable immersion possible for teams. The promise to teams in treating infrastructure configuration as software code is to reduce variations and inherently increase speed in the delivery cycle, by leveraging source control, testing, and deployment capabilities with infrastructure much the same as application code.

IaC provides a control layer within the benchmarks of scalability, security, and compliance. By providing engineering leaders traceable control of environments, we can ensure zero-drift between staging and production. More fundamentally, the simple notion of changes being traceable, testable, and repeatable enables us to mitigate the risk of acting on our infrastructures.

* IaC serves as a control layer, enabling organizations to scale infrastructure without risk of governance.  
* IaC provides engineering leaders with deterministic control, meaning deployments will behave as defined, across all environments.  
* IaC introduces infrastructure into the same life cycle as software.  
* IaC provides automated, observable, documented, and versioned infrastructure.

## 1. <a href="https://www.improwised.com/" target="_blank">Improwised Technologies</a>

**Based:** India | **Founded:** 2011

[LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/company/improwised-technologies/)

Improwised Technologies (India) is passionate about Infrastructure as Code (IaC) and commits to engineering scalable, versioned, and automated infrastructure-as-code (IaC) provisioning using tools like Terraform, Ansible, etc. With a focus on technology leaders, their IaC (infrastructure as code) model allows for speedier rollout times, maximized uptime (99.9%), and optimized infrastructure, making them a solid partner for regulated industries such as finance, healthcare, and SaaS.

Improwised doesn't simply see IaC as a way to use scripts or automation \- they see it as a layer that enables platform reliability, security, and scalability. They have great expertise, using a blend of open-source tools, GitOps workflows, and core platform engineering skills to provide IaC solutions that are developer friendly and aligned with business objectives.

With an emphasis on building secure, automated infrastructure in industries where mistakes aren't an option (finance, healthcare, SaaS), it's easy to see how Improwised stands out. Think Terraform, Ansible, and a serious dose of GitOps, with the end goal of having your infrastructure be versioned and racked out so that it gets rolled out quickly. The simple truth is that their team is not about the tech; the ultimate goal is to help you create an edge against the competition through your infrastructure.

* **Strategy-First Approach**  
  Improwised combines DevOps, GitOps, and IaC principles that align with business objectives that produce cloud-agnostic, automated, resilient infrastructure.  
* **Deep Technical Expertise**  
  Specializing in Kubernetes, Terraform, ArgoCD, and platform engineering. Build developer-first internal platforms that scale with you.  
* **Agile & Scalable Delivery**  
  Lean teams mean fast delivery and low overhead. Embedded specialists become part of the client teams for rapid delivery.

**Why it matters:**

In a business world where infrastructure IS the product, Improwised enables engineering leaders to build scalable platforms without sacrificing agility or control. It is their ability to design, build, and operate native production environments from Day 1 to Day 1000 that is quietly making them the go-to partner for companies that not only want service but are committed to strategic change.

**Important IaC uses:**

* Secure multi-cloud provisioning

## 2. Unosquare

**Founded:** 2009

Unosquare regards Infrastructure as Code (IaC) as fundamental to a truly modern DevOps strategy and is committed to helping enterprises shift from manual, error-prone configurations to an automated, repeatable process. By managing infrastructure as code like application code, Unosquare embraces the architectural principle that infrastructure is defined, deployed, and managed as machine-readable files. IaC creates a consistent, faster delivery and lower operational risks to ensure infrastructure provisioning is ultimately a predictable and controlled process.

**Why it matters:**

IaC, combined with Unosquare's experience, means businesses can have the speed and agility they desire without losing governance or security. Traditional approaches to IT define a problem; i.e., human input leads to inconsistencies, configuration drift, and slow delivery cycles. Instead, IaC allows for every component of infrastructure to provide predictable, auditable outcomes that are easily repeatable. IaC minimizes deployment risk, increases product availability cycles, and allows organizations to scale in a multi-cloud environment.
