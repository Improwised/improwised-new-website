# How Platform Engineering Enforces Security by Design

Platform engineering teams build internal developer platforms (IDPs) that have baseline security controls, such as automated certificate handling, secure connection defaults, continuous vulnerability scans, and multifactor authentication built directly into developer workflows. Automation eliminates manual security tasks, enabling security checks, patching, scanning, access management, and compliance controls to operate seamlessly and systematically.

By treating security as a productproviding it as an internal self-service, developers are empowered to take ownership of code security, shifting the practice left in the software development lifecycle. This active approach reduces vulnerabilities and ensures consistent compliance across environments and releases. Platform engineering also improves collaboration between development and security teams by establishing shared tools and notifications, ensuring fast review and remediation of security issues.

**Why it matters** 

* **Proactive Defense Against Threats**  
  Integrating security early makes applications much more resilient, helping prevent cyber breaches, data leaks, and operational disruption before attackers can exploit vulnerabilities.  
* **Cost Savings and Efficiency**  
  Addressing security during the design and development stages is far less expensive than fixing vulnerabilities after deploymentremediation can cost up to 30 times more post-release. Early security also reduces time spent reacting to breaches, freeing teams to focus on innovation.  
* **Faster, More Reliable Delivery**  
  Automated controls enforce secure code, compliance, and best practices throughout the pipeline. Teams can release products quickly and confidently, instead of enduring costly delays for manual reviews and emergency patching.  
* **Regulatory Compliance**  
  Many data protection laws (GDPR, HIPAA, PCI DSS) require security controls to be built in from the start. Security by design streamlines compliance, reducing the risk of fines and legal consequences.  
* **Enhanced Trust and Reputation**  
  Customers and partners expect products to be safe. Demonstrating a proactive security posture improves market reputation and helps win and retain business, especially in regulated industries and for enterprise contracts.  
* **Reduced Breach Impact**  
  Systems built with security in mind can recover more quickly and limit damage even if a breach occurs because monitoring, access controls, and incident response are already in place.
