## Top 10 Platform Engineering Companies

Platform engineering is no longer optional. In 2025, it's essential for fast-growing businesses. As teams scale, managing infrastructure manually becomes a bottleneck. Platform engineering removes that friction. They need internal platforms that empower developers, automate operations, and deliver faster value.  

We've rounded up 10 companies that are doing just that. Whether you're a CTO, DevOps leader, or startup founder, this list will help you find the right partner to build your future.

## What is Platform Engineering?

Platform engineering builds internal tools that simplify development and streamline software delivery. It’s what happens when you stop reinventing the wheel for every deployment and start thinking in systems.  

Imagine a vending machine for infrastructure—where developers pick what they need and get it instantly, securely, and consistently. That’s the power of an Internal Developer Platform (IDP).

## Why It Matters

- **Faster development:** Less waiting on infra, more shipping code.

- **Reduced burnout:** Fewer tickets and manual handoffs.

- **Higher security & consistency:** Guardrails, not gates.

- **Happier teams:** More autonomy, less friction.

Platform teams are now central to tech organizations—and the best ones are less than 2 years old. This space is moving fast.
