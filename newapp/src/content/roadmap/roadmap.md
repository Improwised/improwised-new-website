roadmap:
  - id: 1
    title: "Phase 1: Discovery and Platform Vision"
    description: "We align the platform with business priorities and delivery targets. The focus is to identify exactly what is slowing engineering velocity, how teams currently build and deploy, and what the platform must solve."
    icon: "Rocket"
    outcomes:
      - "Factual Mapping of existing tools, environments, and infrastructure usage."
      - "Quantified developer pain points and inefficiencies."
      - "Defined Platform scope: a statement of what the platform will solve."
  - id: 2  
    title: "Phase 2: Platform Architecture and Design"
    description: "We define how the platform will be structured and how different components will work together."
    icon: "Rocket"
    outcomes:
      - "An architecture blueprint that minimizes variance and supports modular evolution."
      - "Defined standards for how infrastructure, security, deployments, and access will be handled."
      - "An MVP of the platform that demonstrates essential capabilities in a realistic environment and validates the architectural approach."
  - id: 3    
    title: "Phase 3: Build and Implementation"
    description: "We implement the core platform using the selected tooling and established standards."
    icon: "Rocket"
    outcomes:
      - "A running platform environment backed by container orchestration with the agreed scaling and resource model."
      - "Fully version-controlled infrastructure provisioning using IaC for environment reproducibility."
      - "CI/CD pipelines, enabling consistent and verified deployments."
      - "Integrated operational tooling across auth, observability, and incident analysis."
  - id: 4    
    title: "Phase 4: Developer Onboarding and Adoption"
    description: "We ensure developers can adopt the platform smoothly and incorporate it into their daily workflow."
    icon: "Rocket"
    outcomes:
      - "Self-service access governed by RBAC and least-privilege permissions."
      - "Zero-trust policy applied for service access, secrets handling, and internal communication."
      - "Hands-on onboarding through sessions, walkthrough demos, and real support for developer queries."
      - "Reduced onboarding time for new hires."
  - id: 5    
    title: "Phase 5: Upgrades and Day-2 Operations"
    description: "We continuously refine the platform and support its growth in alignment with business and engineering needs."
    icon: "Rocket"
    outcomes:
      - "Iterative enhancement of templates, pipelines, and guardrails based on real developer needs."
      - "Continuous platform maintenance, reliability improvements, upgrades, and advisory support."
