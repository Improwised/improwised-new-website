faqs:
  - question: "Does platform engineering equate to DevOps with a mindset of a product?"
    answer: "No. Platform engineering is the process of creating the workflows and systems that enable DevOps, and the business mindset ensures that the platform is constantly evolving in response to the needs of developers and the results that can be measured."
  - question: "Do small teams require an internal development platform as an item?"
    answer: "Small teams benefit when they can use several services, a growing frequency of deployment, or rising support demands. A modest MVP platform can cut down on operating costs and also free up developers for development."
  - question: "What is the time frame to get a return on investment from your platform service?"
    answer: "Teams typically see value early when the MVP is launched. ROI increases as adoption increases and workflows are stabilized."
  - question: "What are the metrics the platform's owner keeps track of?"
    answer: "Time to adopt, deployment time, the lead time for any change tickets, volume of tickets, Change failure rate, and cloud spending."
  - question: "What's the main difference between a product platform, an item, and a platform?"
    answer: "Platform as a Product can be used to support the internal workflows of developers. A product platform supports external product delivery."

A lot of engineering teams face slow deployments, high costs, and long cycle times for issues. Developers can move between environments, tools as well as manual steps. Leadership is pushed to deliver, while teams take care of the operational aspects, assist with queries, and work on fragmented processes. These structures hinder output and undermine delivery.

The internal platform being treated as an item can help you get through these cycles. The platform is transformed into an application with a clearly defined goal, quantifiable outputs, and a method for continual changes. The team for the platform functions like any other team in a product that studies the needs of users and outcomes, conducts tests for the effectiveness of improvements, and monitors the adoption.


Improwised teams use this approach within large and mid-sized engineering teams. By utilizing a structured platform, numerous teams can achieve faster deployments and reduce costs for cloud services. In many projects, the speed of deployment increases at least three times faster, and cloud expenditure decreases by 30-40 percent. These changes are based on one principle: treat the platform as a product that supports developers.


## What is "Platform as a Product"?


"Platform as a Product" or "platform as product" is a way of using the internal development platform as a continuous line of product. It is managed by a product owner, a clearly defined goal, a defined plan of action, along with performance measures that measure the real results, such as the speed of deployment, incident reduction, and adoption rates. The team behind the platform focuses on user experience and not infrastructure on its own.


This is different from the "platform as an application" model, in which efforts stop when the platform is delivered. The project mindset is focused on the implementation of tools, whereas an approach to product management involves continuous care, monitoring, and continual iteration.


The platform offers:


* A product-oriented mindset: the decisions relate to the needs of the user and the goals of the business. 
* A product owner is someone accountable for results. 
* Focus on tangible results, including the flow of deployment, adoption, as well as lead time, and the volume of tickets. 
* A lifecycle model that includes launch, expansion, improvement, and finally retirement.


This differs from the standard design, in which the platform is designed as a single-time initiative. Teams develop a set of infrastructure or tools, then ship the work off, and then move into new projects. The system becomes outdated and difficult to maintain, and is not aligned with the requirements of developers.


## The reason why Platform as a Product matters for your business


A platform that is used as a service has an obvious impact on business. Processes for development are more efficient, and incidents decrease because of consistency, and operating costs fall as duplication of effort disappears. Self-service environments and centralized patterns help reduce support requests while increasing the visibility of audits.


* Accelerate delivery cycles by reducing friction during the development and deployment processes. 
* Reduced the volume of incidents because of improved efficiency and consistency of workflows. 
* Cloud spending is reduced through constant improvement 
* Support tickets are declining because of self-service routes and automation, as well as clear processes


This strategy is connected to cognition load reduction. When developers follow well-defined paths and flow patterns that they can concentrate on solving the problem rather than trying to navigate the system. This boosts efficiency and frees engineers with senior positions from supporting duties.


## Fundamental Principles to Treat Your Platform as a Product


1. **Developers are not ticket submitters; they are customers. Submitters.** 
  The platform is designed to support developers. It starts with understanding the user's requirements, their pain points, and limitations. 
2. **Value is measured through adoption and flow.** 
  Output is not some features. The value is in the use of the platform, the amount of time saved, as well as the increased efficiency of the delivery. 
3. **Minimum Viable Platform (MVP) is not a huge build.** 
  Begin with a basic set of workflows to address the real issues. Then, based on the use and feedback. 
4. **Gold-colored paths that are paved roads** 
  Give suggested methods to develop tests, deploy, and run services. This helps reduce drift and variation. 
5. **Lifecycle and platform vision** 
  A clear purpose and mission will guide the decision-making. The platform is developed over time, such as discovery, launch, enhancement, maturation, and finally, retirement.


Making developers customers is the principle. The value of the platform is measured by flow and adoption, and not by the number of tools. A method of measurement starts with a Minimum Viable Platform (MVP) that addresses pressing problems prior to scaling capabilities.


The golden paths of opinion guide teams through standard workflows, with enough flexibility to meet particular requirements. Lifecycle management and strategy for the platform make sure that the platform is constantly evolving with continuous delivery cycles.


## A Practical Guide to Building Internal Platforms for Developers


**Step 1 \- Identify the needs of the developer and map cognitive Load** 
Begin by looking at the workflows of developers. Find bottlenecks and mental load caused by incongruous settings or manual work.


**Step 2 \- Determine Your Minimum Viable Platform as well as outcomes** 
Determine measurable results like the frequency of deployment, the creation time, or the rollback success rate. Create an application MVP that focuses on these outcomes directly.


**Step 3 \- Designing the Experience for Developers Then** 
Explore how developers interact with the platform daily. Pay attention to the interfaces, workflows, and feedback loops between the platform team and users.


**Step 4 \- Implement the Platform using Opinionated defaults** 
Make curated decisions about stacks, such as defined CI/CD pipelines and security baselines, as well as templates for services, to ensure that the system is maintained.


**Step 5 \- Launch, Assess, and Reiterate as a Product team** 
The platform will be released in stages. Collect data on adoption of the platform, frequency of usage, and user feedback to help refine versions.


**Step 6 \- Promote Your Platform to the Internal Market** 
Utilize documents from internal sources, materials for onboarding, as well as champion programmes to help drive the platform's knowledge and take ownership.


**Step 7 \- Create an Ecosystem** 
Offer the APIs, templates for starter projects, and catalogs that support reuse and extension of services as teams join.


## Who is the owner of the platform as an item?


The platform owner is responsible for their roadmap and ensures adoption, and aligns with the business objectives. This job combines management concepts with an understanding of infrastructure.


The owner collaborates with architects on the design of platforms and security teams on compliance, and also with the leaders to establish goals for efficiency and cost. The product's owner has to balance different needs, including technological innovation and stability of operations.


The platform's product owner is responsible for the platform in the same way the product manager is driving the product that customers use.


The role includes:


* Understanding developer needs. 
* Transforming business objectives into platform-specific outcomes. 
* Prioritizing work 
* The management of roadmaps and lifecycles 
* Coordination with security, leadership, and the architecture 
* Tracking the flow of adoption and flow metrics


The owner of the product works with engineers as well as security teams and cloud teams in order to align cloud work with the larger organization's objectives.


## Real-World Patterns, derived from Improwised Projects


Improwised's successful platform implementations that reflect the platform-as-a-product approach. One of the key patterns is the use of [GitOps-driven automation](https://improwised.com/blog/gitops-implementation-guide-automating-infrastructure-delivery/). For a hospital-management system provider, integration with GitOps made it possible to automate the release process for 7,000+ per year. This method changed the speed of deployment between days and hours. This cut down on mistakes made by hand, and increased overall reliability of releases through making the process of deployment transparent and auditable.


Another model focuses on multi-cloud platforms. To create a data lake platform that includes AWS, Google Cloud, and Azure, the team developed an internal platform that unified, allowing seamless provisioning across clouds. This led to 70 percent speedier provisioning of the environment and also maintained 99.9 percent availability. The platform's product-oriented approach provided continuous management of lifecycles and optimized performance across multiple cloud environments.


The most important outcomes of these projects are:


* The speed of deployment was increased threefold or more by using GitOps automation. 
* The goal of uptime to 99.9 percent is met through multi-cloud redundancy as well as lifecycle management for platforms. 
* The operational efficiency can lead to 60-70 percent more efficient provisioning and set-up times. 
* Reduction in error rates thanks to regularization and continual improvement of the platform.


## Common Pitfalls and Strategies to Avoid Them


* **Single-time projects for infrastructure:** Team members provide platforms in a finite amount of time without support for the long term, resulting in demise and debt to technology. Avoid this by assigning a project owner to manage lifecycles, including changes and planning for retirement.


* **Tools over workflows:** Concentrating on deploying tools that do not address the issues of developers leads to lower adoption and a lot of duplicate efforts. Prioritize user discovery and test capabilities against the real requirements before creating.


* **There is no internal advertising:** The platforms are launched without documentation, onboarding, or champions, and developers resort to the old methods. Develop a program for enabling feedback loops and metrics for adoption to increase the use of the platform.


* **Insufficient clarity about ownership:** Lack of a specific product owner leads to a lack of clarity between security, architecture, and operations. Establish the roles early and include the responsibility for results, such as the frequency of deployment and tickets for support.


* **Complexity and compulsory use:** Creating feature-rich platforms or forcing users to adopt them creates anger and makes the platform more complicated. Begin with an MVP that is optional, and build on it based on the voluntary participation.


* **Not paying attention to metrics and scalability:** Platforms are unable to grow without planning capacity and tracking important indicators. Perform stress testing and track the rate of adoption and error recovery time, and cognitive load at the time of launch.


## A platform is a product. DevOps vs. Product Platform


| Aspect | Platform as a Product | DevOps | Product Platform |
| ----- | ----- | ----- | ----- |
| Definition | Internal platforms are managed using the lifecycle of the product, ownership, and metrics to measure developer productivity. | A collaboration shift in culture between operations and development teams throughout the lifecycle of software. | External platforms that provide the sale of products or services to customers. |
| Primary Priority | Experience of developers, metrics for adoption, and constant iteration of internal tools. | Automation of processes, pipelines for CI/CD, and breaking down the silos between dev and operations. | Scalable infrastructure to support end-user applications in addition to revenue generation. |
| Ownership | A dedicated product owner with a plan and alignment with the business. | Teams that are cross-functional and have no single owner. | Product managers focus on the market fit and customer acquisition. |
| Key Metrics | Rate of adoption, in addition to deployment frequency, and cognitive reduction of load. | Speed of deployment, reaction time to an incident, as well as the rate of failure to change. | User growth, revenue per user, churn rate. |
| Scope | Platforms for developers that are internal, such as IDPs with golden pathways. | Complete SDLC from creation to final. | APIs and services that are public-facing are to be consumed externally. |
