      faqs:
        - question: "How is product-centric architecture different from traditional system design?"
          answer: "It depends on the rules of your business and the plan for your product. We don't build systems primarily on how easy they are to use. Instead, we make sure that the architecture fits within the limits of the domain, is flexible, and has the features we wish to add in the future."
        - question: "Do I need microservices for this?"
          answer: "Not all the time. We propose building things based on how big and hard they are to build. A modular monolith is a good way to start sometimes since it can become services over time."
        - question: "Can you help me change an old system?"
          answer: "Yes, of course. We check the architecture, update old systems, and make migration plans that keep critical functions and reduce downtime."
        - question: "What tools or frameworks do you use in?"
          answer: "We use a variety of modern stacks, such as Docker, Kubernetes, Node.js, Python, Java, and .NET. We also use architectural ideas that are based on your demands, not merely what's in style."
        - question: "How long does it take to plan the building?"
          answer: "It could take anywhere from two to six weeks, depending on how big it is. We normally start with a lean architectural canvas and add to it, although it may take longer for huge systems that are hard to change."

        - question: "With open-source technologies, will I be stuck with a certain tech stack?"
          answer: "Not at all. One of the best things about open source is that it doesn't lock you in. You can change or add to your tech stack over time without having to sign contracts or follow licensing rules. We make sure that your architecture can be changed and is modular"
        - question: "What do you do if an open-source library is no longer supported or is no longer useful?"
          answer: "At Improwised, we look closely at each tool's community support, release schedule, and long-term stability. We also build with modularity in mind, so if a library needs to be replaced, it won't cause too much trouble."
        - question: "Can we use open-source technologies with other systems we already have?"
          answer: "Yes, for sure. We often use open-source parts with CRMs, ERPs, payment gateways, and APIs from other companies. Most recent open-source frameworks are made to be easy to add to and operate well with many different platforms and settings."
        - question: "If I use open-source software, do I still need tech support?"
          answer: "Yes. Open-source technologies don't cost anything to use, but you still need qualified developers to set them up, keep them safe, and keep them running. Improwised helps you build a strong base and gives you ongoing support or handover instructions so your team can handle it with ease."

      faqs:
        - question: "What does 'security by default' mean?"
          answer: "It means that the system is safe right away, without having to set it up by hand or install fixes at the last minute. From the start, the design has built-in security, including access control, logging, and encryption."
        - question: "Can Improwised help you get ready for compliance (GDPR, HIPAA, etc.)?"

        - question: "What do you do to keep APIs from being misused?"
          answer: "Our APIs provide tight input and output validation, token-based authentication, IP throttling, and role-based permissions. This helps keep people from using, abusing, or getting access to data they shouldn't."
        - question: "Will security make our development process slower?"
