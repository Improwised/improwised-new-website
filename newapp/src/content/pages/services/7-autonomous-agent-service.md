faqs:
  - question: "What exactly is Agentic AI?"
    answer: "Agentic AI refers to task-specific, autonomous AI systems that we design to handle repeatable technical tasks — such as code generation, testing, bug triaging, or support workflows — within software projects. These aren’t generic chatbots or copilots, but embedded capabilities built for specific workflows."
  - question: "Why does Improwised invest in Agentic AI?"
    answer: "Because it helps us deliver better software, faster. Our in-house AI agents reduce manual effort, minimize human error, and speed up releases, allowing our team to focus more on high-value engineering work."
  - question: "Will my project include AI agents by default?"
    answer: "Only if they’re relevant to your goals. If an AI-driven solution makes sense for a part of your workflow — like automating documentation or support — we might design one for you as part of the custom software we build. But we don’t push AI where it’s not needed."
  - question: "What infrastructure do you use for AI?"
    answer: "We maintain a **private AI lab** with open-source LLMs and internal servers. This allows us to experiment, build, and deploy safely, with no reliance on third-party APIs and full control over compliance and security."
  - question: "Is client data ever exposed to external AI services?"
    answer: "Never. All experiments and deployments happen within secure, self-hosted environments. Data privacy and compliance are core to how we operate."
  - question: "What kinds of tasks has your Agentic AI automated so far?"
    answer: "Code documentation and UI generation, test case creation and QA automation, bug triaging and alert prioritization, CI/CD pipeline optimization, sales content assistance and support queries."
  - question: "Can these agents be adapted over time?"
    answer: "Yes. Since we manage them internally, we can continuously improve their performance, retrain them as workflows evolve, and track their behavior — all under strict version control."
  - question: "What are the benefits for clients?"
    answer: "While our clients don’t 'buy' AI agents, they benefit from faster releases with fewer errors, enhanced platform features, automation of repetitive workflows, full data privacy and no third-party exposure."
