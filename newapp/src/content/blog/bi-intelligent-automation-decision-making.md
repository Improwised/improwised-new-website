faqs:
  - question: "What is Business Intelligence (BI), and how does it assist people in making choices?"
    answer: "Business Intelligence (BI) is a set of tools and methods that turn raw data into useful information. BI helps leaders make decisions more quickly and accurately by showing them how things are going, discovering trends, and making guesses about what will happen."
  - question: "What is Intelligent Automation (IA), and how does it vary from automation that isn't smart?"
    answer: "Intelligent Automation combines RPA and AI/ML to work with unstructured data, copy human decisions, and get better over time. Intelligent automation (IA) is better for complex business processes that change a lot since it can change when it needs to, unlike normal automation."
  - question: "How do BI and Intelligent Automation work together?"
    answer: "BI looks for patterns or strange things in data, and Intelligent Automation does something about such patterns. For example, if BI notices that there isn't enough stock, it can automatically arrange a fresh order right away. This is a mechanism for making decisions that doesn't let anyone in."
  - question: "What are the advantages for businesses of using BI and Intelligent Automation together?"
    answer: "The integration speeds things up, cuts down on manual work, makes things more accurate, and makes it easier to grow. It helps businesses move from knowing about data to using it automatically in real time."

## The Change to Making Decisions Faster and Smarter

In today's fast-paced digital world, making quick decisions based on data isn't just a way to get ahead; it's necessary for survival. Even though it's important, many companies still employ antiquated methods or make judgments solely on gut reactions. This could lead to delays, missing opportunities, or operations that aren't as efficient as they could be.

![How Business Intelligence and Intelligent Automation Drive Smarter Decision-Making?]($lib/images/blogs/bi-intelligent-automation-decision-making-body.svg)

Business Intelligence (BI) and Intelligent Automation (IA) go hand in hand to turn raw data into valuable information and then into actions that happen automatically. This article examines the influence of this pair on decision-making processes in 2025 and subsequent years.

What Business Intelligence (BI) Does
Business Intelligence (BI) is more than just charts and dashboards. BI is a set of tools and methods that help you understand a lot of data. Power BI, Tableau, and Looker are some of the technologies that assist people in making decisions.

* Look for patterns and things that surprise you.  
* Make predictions by looking at how things have transpired in the past.

This means that the method will be more precise and less based on guesswork.  
**Example:** A sales team sees that leads are dropping in a given area, finds a problem with a campaign, and addresses it immediately.

## What is Intelligent Automation, and how is it changing?

The next step in automating tasks is Intelligent Automation (IA). It uses AI, machine learning, and robotic process automation (RPA) to make judgments like a person would.

* Handle unstructured data like conversations, emails, and PDFs.  
* Learn from your mistakes and get better over time.

Rule-based automation can't adapt, while IA systems can. For instance, they can do more than just process invoices; they can also find problems, flag duplicate payments, or even negotiate prices based on past data.

## When BI and Automation Come Together: Set the Real Power Free

That's when the real magic happens: when BI insights make things happen on their own. Think of a BI dashboard that not only sees that supplies are running short, but also places an order to get more.  
That's the main idea behind automating decisions.  

**Some good things are:**

* Changes to data get answers right away  
* No more need for manual work  
* Processes that can do well on their own

Companies that work with partners like Improvised are putting these skills together by making centralized intelligence layers and one-of-a-kind automation processes. This makes sure that businesses not only know what's going on but also take action immediately.

## A Quick Table of Comparisons: Business Intelligence vs. Intelligent Automation

| Feature | Business Intelligence (BI) | Intelligent Automation (IA) |
| ----- | ----- | ----- |
| Concentrate on | Analysis & Insights | Execution & Workflow |
| Result | Reports with Pictures | Done things |
| Basic tools | Power BI, Tableau | UiPath, Automation Anywhere |
| How much AI is there? | Not very high | Medium to High |

## Moving from analysis to action in actual life:

Let's imagine that payments to vendors suddenly show up on your financial screen.

* BI notices a suspicious pattern in how bills are paid.  
* IA cancels approvals, tells finance, and starts an internal review process.

This closed-loop method cuts down on fraud, saves time, and makes people more responsible without having to watch them.

## Why BI and Automation Will Work Together in 2025

Gartner forecasts that by 2026, more than 70% of businesses will use BI and automation tools. This is because more and more people are using end-to-end intelligence solutions.

According to McKinsey, teams that use intelligent process automation work 25–35% faster.

To stay on top of these changes, companies are using more and more tools like [Business Intelligence and Automation](https://www.improwised.com/services/business-intelligence-and-automation/) to link their smart workflows and decision-making processes.

## How to Start Using BI and Automation

If you're ready to connect data and action:

* Take a look at how your data is moving now— Be aware of where your data is and how it's being utilized.  
* Pick a BI platform: Choose tools that work well with your systems.  
* Look for workflows that happen a lot and have a big effect on the business to find jobs that can be automated.  
* Pilot, measure, and grow: Take little steps at first, see what happens, and then build up.

## What the Future Holds: BI, Automation, and AI That Make Things

Generative AI speeds up the merging of BI and IA even more in 2025:

* Dashboards that talk to you: You can ask questions in clear English and get answers immediately.  
* Systems that have prescriptive intelligence not only tell you what happened, but they also advise you what to do about it.  
* Self-driving workflows: LLMs deal with problems and write back.

It's not just based on data; it's based on data that is used.

## Let Data and Automation Take the Lead

Following BI and smart automation is no longer a choice; it is now a key part of strategy. They all work together to help companies:

* Answer more quickly  
* Do less work by hand.  
* Increase accuracy and return on investment.
