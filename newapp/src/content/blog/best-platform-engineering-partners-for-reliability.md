## Introduction 

In the landscape of platform engineering, we were also actively engaged with emerging trends, while experiencing extraordinary growth in multi-cloud and hybrid infrastructure adoption, driven largely by the business need for more resiliency and flexibility. Platform engineering has been described as the engineering of internal platforms for development teams, or more simply, internal platforms that take on the costs of infrastructure and operations engineering so that developers can just ship product features. The differentiator is that internal systems are packaged and bundled as products for developers to use, and that product teams design, operate, and evolve these internal systems so that those products are always successful.

**Technical Depth :**

* Design platform components to support vendor-agnostic orchestration (Kubernetes, Crossplane)  
* Leverage shared monitoring, logging, and policy engines, to enforce security and compliance in environments.  
* Use IaC patterns that abstract multiple cloud back ends and just map provider specifics.

**Why is it necessary:**

Multi-cloud provides risk mitigation for vendor lock-in, cost, and mitigated risk, but a solid technical foundation must be built to orchestrate the multi-cloud experience.

**Advanced tip:**

Service mesh architecture enables the consolidation of networking and security policies across different cloud domains.

**Example Workflow:**

* IaC defines environment specs for each cloud.  
* CI/CD pipeline deploys the Cloud native artifacts as multiple cloud-region Kubernetes clusters.  
* The platform automatically scales workloads and synchronises configuration updates (i.e., playbook updates for any dependent changes) through Gitops to maintain the current state at all times.

**Key Considerations:**

**Internal Developer Platforms:** build self-service developer tools and frameworks that developers can use to manage the lifecycle of their applications.

**Automation:** automate the processes (provisioning, deployment, monitoring) so you and your team can spend time developing software and automating\!

**Consistency and standardization:** build standard practice patterns for how we define the secure build, deploy, and management of software, and the best practices.

**Developer Experience:** build tools that improve the developer experience, but also be aware of the developer workflows that may support increased productivity with a lower cognitive load. 

**Collaboration and Enablement:** Act as a bridge between development, operations, and security to create fundamental integration and collaboration. 

**Scalable:** Create a solution that scales with the organization and adapts to changing technology stacks. 

**Security and Compliance:** Embed security and compliance by default through platform-level controls and policies.

**Founded: 2011**

[LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/company/improwised-technologies/)

Platform Engineering, at the very heart of how Improwised Technologies enables enterprises to deliver software better, faster, more securely, and more resiliently, is a set of practices that look to develop a strong internal platform for developers, so that they can leverage self-service infrastructure, automation, and governance without being weighed down by operational overhead. This practice serves as a bridge between development, operations, and security, allowing teams to innovate without friction.

Improwised Technologies does not view Platform Engineering as simply being about infrastructure management; rather, looking at it from an ecosystem perspective where the end goal is an internal developer platform (IDP) that abstracts away the redundant infrastructure, and proposes a seamless developer experience. By embedding automation, security, and observability into the platform, organizations can achieve a true reduction in lead time, operational risk, whilst also achieving full scaleability.

**Key Components:**

* Platform Engineering \+ Developer Platforms (IDPs) are important for regulated industries like healthcare and adtech  
* Automates deployment pipelines so you can release 2 \- 3x faster  
* 99.99% uptime for mission-critical systems  
* Deep expertise in hybrid/multi-cloud, Kubernetes at scale, CI/CD automation  
* Optimized cloud cost (up to 30% savings) and reduced DevOps tasks by 80%

**Why It Matters:**

Typically, in traditional DevOps, developers have too much burden with infrastructure that slows delivery cycles and creates human error. Platform Engineering eliminates these burdens by providing pre-built, reusable services with guardrails, allowing developers to write code, not run infrastructure. For our clients that are cloud-native, microservices, and Kubernetes, this is the key to speed, reliability, and optimized costs.

**Why Platform Engineering Uses?**

* Expertise in IaC, CI/CD, Cloud-native  
* Strong DevSecOps integration  
* Proven ability to deliver enterprise transformations
