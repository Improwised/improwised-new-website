      faqs:
        - question: "When should I think about setting up an AI lab in-house?"
          answer: "If your data is private (such as patient records, legal papers, or intellectual property) or if you're making proprietary models that need privacy, performance optimization, or lower-cost long-term scalability, you might want to think about an in-house lab."
        - question: "Does it cost more than using the public cloud?"
          answer: "At first, yeah. But over time, hosting big models and doing a lot of work in-house sometimes costs less overall, especially when the consumption is constant or at scale."
        - question: "Do I need a GPU cluster to use AI models?"
          answer: "It depends on what you need it for. A few high-memory CPUs or a single GPU may be enough for simple models or only inference. When training or fine-tuning, it's better to have more than one GPU."
        - question: "Does Improwised work with configurations that are air-gapped?"
          answer: "Yes, we help build and set up isolated environments that don't have access to the internet from the outside. These are excellent for workloads that need to follow strict rules or are secret."

        - question: "Can the agents learn from what users say?"
          answer: "Yes. We create feedback loops that help agents get better over time by teaching them what to do better or stay away from, depending on user inputs."
        - question: "How long does it take to make an agent that works?"
          answer: "It takes 2 to 4 weeks to set up a basic agent. Depending on how complicated they are, more advanced or thoroughly integrated agents may take 6 to 10 weeks."

        - question: "Why shouldn't I use public AI APIs to store private information?"
          answer: "Public APIs often keep inputs, don't make it clear how they use data, and may be open to audits or leaks from outside sources. Private deployments lower these hazards."
        - question: "Do I need a big team of infrastructure people to host LLMs in-house?"
          answer: "Not always. We can put containerized models on your current cloud or edge hardware and then teach your staff how to use them."
        - question: "What models can I use by myself?"
          answer: "We use open models like Mistral, LLaMA, Falcon, and Mixtral. We assist you in picking and making changes to models that fit your needs."
        - question: "Can this method work in hybrid environments?"
          answer: "Yes. You can do sensitive work in-house and leverage APIs from outside sources for work that isn't sensitive. We create routing logic that can change to work with hybrid AI."
        - question: "How do you deal with versioning and rolling back?"
          answer: "Each model build is stored in a secure registry with the ability to roll back to an earlier version. You can always go back to safe versions with audit logs."

faqs:
  - question: "What exactly is Agentic AI?"
    answer: "Agentic AI refers to task-specific, autonomous AI systems that we design to handle repeatable technical tasks — such as code generation, testing, bug triaging, or support workflows — within software projects. These aren’t generic chatbots or copilots, but embedded capabilities built for specific workflows."
  - question: "Why does Improwised invest in Agentic AI?"
    answer: "Because it helps us deliver better software, faster. Our in-house AI agents reduce manual effort, minimize human error, and speed up releases, allowing our team to focus more on high-value engineering work."
  - question: "Will my project include AI agents by default?"
    answer: "Only if they’re relevant to your goals. If an AI-driven solution makes sense for a part of your workflow — like automating documentation or support — we might design one for you as part of the custom software we build. But we don’t push AI where it’s not needed."
  - question: "What infrastructure do you use for AI?"
    answer: "We maintain a **private AI lab** with open-source LLMs and internal servers. This allows us to experiment, build, and deploy safely, with no reliance on third-party APIs and full control over compliance and security."
  - question: "Is client data ever exposed to external AI services?"
    answer: "Never. All experiments and deployments happen within secure, self-hosted environments. Data privacy and compliance are core to how we operate."
  - question: "What kinds of tasks has your Agentic AI automated so far?"
    answer: "Code documentation and UI generation, test case creation and QA automation, bug triaging and alert prioritization, CI/CD pipeline optimization, sales content assistance and support queries."
  - question: "Can these agents be adapted over time?"
    answer: "Yes. Since we manage them internally, we can continuously improve their performance, retrain them as workflows evolve, and track their behavior — all under strict version control."
  - question: "What are the benefits for clients?"
    answer: "While our clients don’t 'buy' AI agents, they benefit from faster releases with fewer errors, enhanced platform features, automation of repetitive workflows, full data privacy and no third-party exposure."
