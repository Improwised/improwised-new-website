Why we needed a website revamp? 

As an evolving organization, it became the need of the hour to empower teams with flexibility and independence. We wanted to give each team the freedom to manage the needs of their departmental content. 

However, we didn’t want to let go of the benefits of a static website like reliability, cost-effectiveness, ease of maintenance, and much better SEO. 

To achieve the best of both worlds for the new website, we decided to use our forte of creating a tailor-made solution.
