            Platform engineering makes real goods, including internal developer platforms that treat engineers like customers. DevOps, on the other hand, focuses on cultural practices and integrating tools. DevOps personnel often get in the way since they have to deal with requests and keep tools up to date. Platform engineering makes it possible for developers to set up what they need right away on their own.

            DevOps is the way of doing things, while platform engineering is the infrastructure product that lets that way of doing things work on a larger scale. What happened? Instead of responding to tickets, DevOps staff become platform product managers.

            Through our platform engineering as a service, we create internal developer platforms (IDPs) that give your teams real freedom, with on-demand infrastructure, automated environments, and self-service platform features that don't need a PhD in Kubernetes. Backstage, Kubernetes, and GitOps pipelines are all part of our platforms, which make experiences that developers really want to use.
